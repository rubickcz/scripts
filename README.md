## Scripts ##
This is a collection of simple scripts which ease my common tasks.
Some of them are authored by me, the rest was found on internet. Read comments inside the scripts for instructions how to use them.

+ **archive-downloads.sh** - Simple cleaner of Downloads directory
+ **colors.sh** - Prints colored table with avaiable terminal colors
+ **create-script.sh** - Creates a simple skeleton for a new script
+ **create-vcan.sh** - Helper script for adding a virtual CAN interface
+ **feh_browser.sh** - Allows browsing through images in feh even when only one file was opened (useful for file managers)
+ **monitor-toggle.sh** - Simply switch on or off the internal laptop display
+ **resize-photos.sh** - Script I use to prepare photos for web upload
+ **video-text.sh** - Overlay a text over a video
+ **website.sh** - Helper for editing of my website

You will probably also need **functions.sh** in your PATH to run the scripts. It contains common function used in most of them.
