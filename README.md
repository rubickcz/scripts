# Scripts #
This is a collection of simple scripts which ease my common tasks.
Some of them are authored by me, the rest was found on internet. Read comments inside the scripts for instructions how to use them.

+ **alert.sh** - Plays a short notofication sound
+ **archive-downloads.sh** - Simple cleaner of downloads directory
+ **colors.sh** - Prints colored table with avaiable terminal colors
+ **create-script.sh** - Creates a simple skeleton for a new script
+ **dvd-backup.sh** - Converts movie on a DVD to a MP4 file
+ **feh_browser.sh** - Allows browsing through images in feh even when only one file was opened
+ **monitor-toggle.sh** - Toggle the secondary display
+ **resize-photos.sh** - Script I use to prepare photos for web upload
+ **video-text.sh** - Overlay a text over a video
+ **website.sh** - Helper for editing of my website

You will probably also need **functions.sh** in your PATH to run the scripts. It contains common function used in most of them.

## Installation

Simply clone a repository somewhere and add its location to PATH (or symlink it to your ~/bin/)
