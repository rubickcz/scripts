## Scripts ##
This is a collection of simple scripts which ease my common tasks.
Some of them are authored by me, the rest was found on internet.

+ **archive-downloads.sh** - Simple cleaner of Downloads directory
+ **colors.sh** - Prints colored table with avaiable terminal colors
+ **create-vcan.sh** - Helper script for adding virtual CAN interface
+ **feh_browser.sh** - Allows browse through images in feh even when only one file was opened (useful for file managers)
+ **resize-photos.sh** - Script I use to prepare photos for web upload

You will probably also need **functions.sh** in your PATH to run the scripts. It contains common function used in most of them.
